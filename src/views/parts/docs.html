                        Adding code snippets to Office documents like Word or PowerPoint often disrupts the original
                        formatting, especially the syntax highlighting. 😢 Furthermore, the typical dark theme of most
                        IDEs doesn't work well for presentations. While converting code to images is an option, it often
                        suffers from non-transparent background, and apparently not as crystal clear as text. 😖

                        So, is there a better way to include highlighted code snippets in these documents? 🤔
                        <b>Absolutely!</b> That's where Code Paste comes in. 😆 Simply paste your code into the left
                        panel, choose your preferred language, and with a single click, you'll have a beautifully
                        highlighted code snippet ready to go.

                        You may wonder, why "Code Paste"? 😕 Well, as you may know, "paste" can be both a verb and a
                        noun. 😏
