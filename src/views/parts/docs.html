                        Adding code snippets to Office documents like Word or PowerPoint could be a challenge,
                        especially when you want to preserve the syntax highlighting. ðŸ˜¢ Furthermore, the typical dark
                        themes of most IDEs doesn't work well for presentations. While converting code into images is an
                        option, it often suffers from non-transparent background, and apparently not as flexible or
                        crystal clear as text. ðŸ˜–

                        So, is there a better way to embed highlighted code snippets in these documents? ðŸ¤”
                        <b>Absolutely,</b> and that's where Code Paste comes in! ðŸ˜† Simply paste your code into the left
                        panel, choose your preferred language and color scheme. With a few clicks, you'll have a
                        beautifully highlighted code snippet ready to go. ðŸ˜‹
