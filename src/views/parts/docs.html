                        Adding code snippets to Office documents like Word or PowerPoint often disrupts the original
                        formatting, especially the syntax highlighting. ðŸ˜¢ Furthermore, the typical dark theme of most
                        IDEs doesn't work well for presentations. While converting code to images is an option, it often
                        suffers from non-transparent background, and apparently not as crystal clear as text. ðŸ˜–

                        So, is there a better way to include highlighted code snippets in these documents? ðŸ¤”
                        <b>Absolutely!</b> That's where Code Paste comes in. ðŸ˜† Simply paste your code into the left
                        panel, choose your preferred language, and with a single click, you'll have a beautifully
                        highlighted code snippet ready to go.
