## Development

If you find Code Paste useful and want to host it on your own, this section will be useful. By the way, feel free to contribute to this project. You can report bugs, suggest new features, or even submit a pull request. üòä

### Quick Start

Code Paste is written in native HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To start development, clone the repo first, then install required packages.

```bash
npm install
npm run init    # initialize placeholder files
```

Then, you can run the project. There are three options for this.

```bash
npm run build  # build for production
npm run dev    # build for development and watch for changes
```

> To preview the project locally, I recommend using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin for Visual Studio Code. Just open `dist/index.html` after your local server is on.

### Code Samples

Code Paste provides sample code for each supported language. The supported languages are listed in `languages/lang.yml`, grouped by their categories. All the code samples are placed under `languages/samples/` directory. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> The display order of the language options in the final webpage is exactly the same as that in `lang.yml`.

Managing language options in HTML and JavaScript is tedious, so there is a script to automatically generate related code. You should run this command after modifying the language list or adding new samples. This will generate `src/js/samples.js` and `src/views/components/languages.html`.

```bash
npm run sample
```

To add a new language, first add it to `languages/lang.yml`. In the suitable category, add a new list item in the format of `key value`, where `key` is the language id of [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages), and the `value` is the display name of the language in the select box. Then, create a new file `{key}.txt` under `languages/samples/` and write your sample code in it. Finally, add this language to `.babelrc` so that it can be correctly loaded.

> [!WARNING]
>
> `npm run dev` will not watch for changes under `languages/` directory. So you have to manually update it.

### Customization

Since I removed sensitive information from the project, you need to run `npm run init` to create placeholder files even if you don't need them. These files are placed under `src/views/components/`.

**Analytics**

In file `statistics.html`, and place all your scripts into it. If you don't need them, just leave this file empty. Here is an example for this file.

```html
<!-- Clarity -->
<script type="text/javascript">
    (function (c, l, a, r, i, t, y) {
        c[a] = c[a] || function () { (c[a].q = c[a].q || []).push(arguments) };
        t = l.createElement(r); t.async = 1; t.src = "https://www.clarity.ms/tag/" + i;
        y = l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0]; y.parentNode.insertBefore(t, y);
    })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "***key***");
</script>
<!-- Baidu Analytics -->
<script>
    var _hmt = _hmt || [];
    (function () {
        var hm = document.createElement("script");
        hm.src = "https://hm.baidu.com/hm.js?******key*******";
        var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
        s.parentNode.insertBefore(hm, s);
    })();
</script>
```

**Notification**

For users who visit your website for the first time, you may want to prompt a notice or agreement. In `notification.html`, write your custom `<div>` for it. The default class for it is `notification`, you can change it and add your own CSS style.

```html
<div class="notification">
    <p>Greetings from all members of Tony's Studio!</p>
</div>
```

**Support**

If you want to add a support page, write it in `support.html`. Like notification, the default class for it is `coffee` and you can customize it. If you add this, there will be an extra support button in the center of the page.

```html
<div class="coffee">
    <img src="url or local path" alt="WeChat Pay" title="Scan to support me">
    <p>We appreciate your sponsorship!üåπ</p>
</div>
```

### Self-hosting

There is still one step before you can host Code Paste on your website. I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for lovely icons, and the linked JavaScript only works for my domain. Therefore, you have to get your kit [here](https://fontawesome.com/kits) and replace the link in `src/views/components/head.html`.

After all these are done, just copy `dist` folder to your server and enjoy!üéâ
